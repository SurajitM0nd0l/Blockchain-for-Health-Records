## **Project Title:**  
**Decentralized Health Records Management (DHRM)**  

---

## **Project Description:**  
The **Decentralized Health Records Management (DHRM)** system is a blockchain-based platform that securely stores and manages patients' medical records. The platform ensures **privacy, transparency, and accessibility** by enabling patients to control who can view their medical history. By leveraging **Ethereum smart contracts**, this system eliminates the risks associated with centralized health data storage, such as data breaches and unauthorized access.

---

## **Project Vision:**  
The vision of DHRM is to **revolutionize healthcare data management** by providing a **secure, immutable, and patient-centric** system. This system empowers individuals with **full ownership and control** over their medical records, ensuring **seamless and secure** data sharing with healthcare providers.

## **Future Scope:**  
1. **Integration with Healthcare Providers:**  
   - Enabling hospitals, clinics, and doctors to access and update patient records in real-time.  

2. **NFT-based Health Records:**  
   - Tokenizing health records as NFTs to provide **ownership proof and traceability**.  

3. **AI-powered Health Insights:**  
   - Analyzing patient history using AI to offer **predictive healthcare solutions**.  

4. **Interoperability with IoT Devices:**  
   - Syncing data from **wearables** (smartwatches, fitness bands) for real-time health tracking.  

5. **Cross-chain Compatibility:**  
   - Expanding the system to work across multiple blockchain networks for better accessibility.  

6. **Emergency Access Feature:**  
   - Allowing **emergency access** to healthcare providers in life-threatening situations.
